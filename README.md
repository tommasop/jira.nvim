## Configuration

```lua
require('jira').setup({
  -- Jira connection settings
  jira = {
    base = "https://your-domain.atlassian.net", -- Base URL of your Jira instance
    email = "your-email@example.com",           -- Your Jira email
    token = "your-api-token",                   -- Your Jira API token
    limit = 200,                                -- Global limit of tasks per view
  },

  -- Saved JQL queries for the JQL tab
  -- Use %s as a placeholder for the project key
  queries = {
    ["Backlog"] = "project = '%s' AND (sprint is EMPTY OR sprint not in openSprints()) AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY Rank ASC",
    ["My Tasks"] = "assignee = currentUser() AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY updated DESC",
  },

  -- Project-specific overrides
  -- Still think about this config, maybe not good enough
  projects = {
    ["DEV"] = {
      story_point_field = "customfield_10035",      -- Custom field ID for story points
      custom_fields = { -- Custom field to display in markdown view
        { key = "customfield_10016", label = "Acceptance Criteria" }
      },
    }
  }
})
