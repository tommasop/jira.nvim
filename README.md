## Configuration

```lua
require('jira').setup({
  -- Jira connection settings
  jira = {
    base = "https://your-domain.atlassian.net", -- Base URL of your Jira instance
    email = "your-email@example.com",           -- Your Jira email
    token = "your-api-token",                   -- Your Jira API token
    limit = 200,                                -- Global limit of tasks per view
  },

  -- Saved JQL queries for the JQL tab
  -- Use %s as a placeholder for the project key
  queries = {
    ["Backlog"] = "project = '%s' AND (sprint is EMPTY OR sprint not in openSprints()) AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY Rank ASC",
    ["My Tasks"] = "assignee = currentUser() AND statusCategory != Done ORDER BY updated DESC",
  },

  -- Project-specific overrides
  projects = {
    ["MOBILE"] = {
      story_point_field = "customfield_12345",      -- Custom field ID for story points
      acceptance_criteria_field = "customfield_10011", -- Custom field ID for AC
    }
  }
})
```

## Usage

Run the following command to open the Jira board:

```vim

```

If you don't provide a project key, you will be prompted to enter one.
